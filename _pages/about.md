Assistant Professor

I am an assistant professor at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University. From 2019 to 2021, I was a CMI and Resnick postdoc in the CMS Department of California Institute of Technology, working with Prof. Steven Low and Prof. Adam Wierman. I obtained my Ph.D. degree from Harvard SEAS working with Prof. Na Li in 2019. I obtained my B.S. degree from Tsinghua University in Beijing, China in 2014. 

I am broadly interested in the control, optimization, and machine learning. Particularly, my recent research focuses on developing frameworks that take advantages of the methods and philosophies in both control theory (LQR, robust control, MPC, etc) and RL (Q-learning, policy gradient methods, etc). These two sets of methods are developed based on very different philosophies, yet I believe the two have their unique advantages that complement each other very well, and therefore the combination of the two will yield powerful algorithms that can achieve the best of both worlds. Another focus of my research is on multi-agent networked systems, particularly how to develop scalable and localized decision rules for the coordination of heterogeneous agents. On the practical side, my research is driven by applications like energy/power systems, IoT, transportation systems, robot teams, etc.

**I am expected to recurit 1-2 students in the Fall 2023 admision cycle. If you are interested in working with me, feel free to reach out!**
