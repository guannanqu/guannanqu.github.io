I am an assistant professor at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University. From 2019 to 2021, I was a CMI and Resnick postdoc in the CMS Department of California Institute of Technology, working with Prof. Steven Low and Prof. Adam Wierman. I obtained my Ph.D. degree from Harvard SEAS working with Prof. Na Li in 2019. I obtained my B.S. degree from Tsinghua University in Beijing, China in 2014. 

I am broadly interested in control, optimization, and machine learning. Particularly, I strive to develop theories that make machine learning applicable in real-world large scale engineering systems. My research is interdisciplinary in nature that develops new mathematical tools in machine/reinforcement learning, control theory, optimization, network science and applies these tools to cyber physical systems, power systems, transportation systems, robotics and beyond, with provable performance and resilience guarantee. For more details, please see the [research](research) page. 

My CV can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1M3vk4epE2VabphwW6PL0HAR_4n4-J3eG/view?usp=sharing) (updated in Dec 2023).

**I am recruiting postdocs through the [CBI fellowship](https://carnegiebosch.cmu.edu/fellowships/index.html). If you are interested, feel free to reach out!**

### Recent updates 
- Our [paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9721402) has been selected as the 3rd paper out of the top 5 papers
chosen among over a thousand articles published in the IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid (TSG) in the past 3 years.
- I received NSF CAREER Award (2023)!
- Recent paper highlights:
  - We applied the Scalable Reinforcement Learning framework (which we proposed a few years ago in this [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.02906)) to a microgrid inverter control problem and showed superior scalability of the proposed framework! See preprint [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.04371.pdf). 
  - We proposed a distributed networked MPC framework with provable dynamic regret guarantee for networked control problems! See preprint [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.06194.pdf).
  - We proposed an ISS-Lyapunov based neural certificate framework to stabilize networked dynamical systems! Accepted to L4DC 2023 as oral presentation. See paper [here](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v211/zhang23a.html).
- Three new members joined my group (Fall 2023). Welcome, Zeji, Chaoyi, and Muhammed!
