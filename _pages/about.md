Assistant Professor

Contact: gqu [at] andrew.cmu.edu  
Office: Porter B22


I am an assistant professor at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University. From 2019 to 2021, I was a CMI and Resnick postdoc in the CMS Department of California Institute of Technology, working with Prof. Steven Low and Prof. Adam Wierman. I obtained my Ph.D. degree from Harvard SEAS working with Prof. Na Li in 2019. I obtained my B.S. degree from Tsinghua University in Beijing, China in 2014. 

I am broadly interested in control, optimization, and machine learning. Particularly, I strive to develop theories that make machine learning applicable in real-world large scale engineering systems. My research is interdisciplinary in nature that develops new mathematical tools in machine/reinforcement learning, control theory, optimization, network science and applies these tools to cyber physical systems, power systems, transportation systems, robotics and beyond, with provable performance and resilience guarantee. For more details, please see the [research](research) page. 


**I am expected to recurit 1-2 students in the Fall 2023 admision cycle. If you are interested in working with me, feel free to reach out!**
